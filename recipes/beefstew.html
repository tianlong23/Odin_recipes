        <li>2 Tbsp Gluten-free All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Olive Oil</li>
        <li>½ Yellow Onion</li>
        <li>4 Garlic Cloves</li>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325° F</li>
        <li>Season the beef chunks on all sides with salt and pepper. Sprinkle the flour over and toss the seasoned beef to coat it on all sides</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Brown the beef in batches, on all sides, for 3-4 minutes per batch. Don’t worry about cooking the beef all the way through at this stage. Transfer the browned beef to a plate and set aside</li>
        <li>Add the onions, garlic, and carrots to the Dutch oven, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2-3 minutes, or until slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes, beef broth, tomato paste, bay leaf, thyme, and Worcestershire sauce, and use a wooden spoon to scrape the browned bits from the bottom of the pot.</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring, and return the beef to the pot. Cover the Dutch oven, and transfer to the preheated oven</li>
        <li>Cook the stew for 2-2.5 hours, or until the beef is very tender. Remove the bay leaf. Taste the stew and season with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Serve warm.</li>
